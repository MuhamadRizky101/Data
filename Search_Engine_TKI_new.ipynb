Korea.net · Social distancing extended 2 weeks, vaccine pass rule widened By Min Yea-Ji and Lee Jihae The government has extended for two weeks social distancing measures limiting the number of people at a private gathering to four and imposing a 9 p.m. curfew for restaurants and cafes. The move seeks to reorganize the medical response system and counter the threat of the omicron variant of COVID-19. Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum on Dec. 31 told a meeting of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters that he chaired at Government Complex-Seoul, \"We need time to prepare before the omicron variant, which is alarmingly contagious, can spread nationwide.\" \"We will extend ongoing social distancing measures for two weeks.\" Department stores, hypermarkets and large marts, which had been exempt from the vaccine pass rule, were added to the list of places requiring visitors to show such passes. The new measure will be applied for two weeks from Jan. 3-16. Vaccine passes for youth will be required from March 1, when the spring school semester stars, with a trial period of one month. Under a \"pay first, settle later\" format, the government will also compensate small business owners and the self-employed for having to forfeit the year-end peak season due to stronger quarantine measures. The prime minister said, \"This past year was extremely harsh but also a good time to confirm the people\\'s solidarity,\" thanking the public for participating in social distancing. jesimin@korea.kr Japan urged to stop UNESCO bid for forced labor mine The government on Dec. 28 urged Japan to immediately retract its bid to have the Sado mine, where Koreans and POWs were forced to work during World War II, gain UNESCO World Heritage status. (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) By Kim Eun-young and Yoon Sojung The government has demanded that Japan immediately retract its bid to have the Sado mine, where Koreans were forced to work during the Japanese colonial period on the Korean Peninsula, for UNESCO World Heritage status. Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Choi Youngsam on Dec. 28 said in a commentary, \"The Korean government finds it deeply deplorable that while the Japanese government has not fully implemented the World Heritage Committee\\'s decisions and its own pledge concerning the \\'Sites of Japan\\'s Meiji Industrial Revolution,\\' Japan\\'s Agency for Cultural Affairs has designated the \\'Sado mine,\\' another site where Koreans were forced to work, as a candidate for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\" To get the facilities of its Meiji Industrial Revolution, including Hashima (Battleship) Island, on the list of UNSECO World Heritage, the Japanese government in 2015 admitted to using Koreans and prisoners of war (POWs) as forced workers and pledged to build an information center to inform the world of this and honor the victims, but failed to keep its word. Thus the committee\\'s decision at its 44th session in July expressed \"strong regret\" over Tokyo\\'s failure to take follow-up measures as promised and urged improvement in its explanation of forced labor \"The Korean government will sternly respond with the international community including UNESCO to prevent sites where people were forced to work against their will from being inscribed as a World Heritage site without sufficient explanation of such historical facts,\" the spokesperson said. Japan forced Koreans and POWs to work at the Sado mine in the island nation\\'s Niigata Prefecture during the Pacific theater (1931-45) of World War II. (Screen capture from mine\\'s official homepage) During the Pacific theater (1931-45) of World War II, approximately 1,200 Koreans were forced to work at the mine to dig for copper and steel to produce war materials. Japan\\'s Agency for Cultural Affairs on the same day selected the mine located in Niigata Prefecture as a candidate for UNESCO World Heritage. It will decide whether to submit an application to that end by Feb. 1, 2022. Kyun Jongho, the ministry\\'s director general for cultural affairs, later summoned Kazuo Chujo, director of the Public Information and Cultural Center at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to the ministry\\'s headquarters in Seoul to lodge a complaint over the issue. eykim86@korea.kr 🎧 7,000 more foreign workers to be allowed entry next year The government next year will allow 7,000 more foreign workers to enter the country under the \"non-professional\" (E-9) employee visa to raise the overall number to 59,000. Shown are Uzbek workers on May 14 at a watermelon greenhouse in Yanggu-gun County, Gangwon-do Province. (Yonhap News) Korea.net · 7,000 more foreign workers to be allowed entry next year By Lee Jihae The government next year will raise the number of foreign workers allowed to enter the nation under the \"non-professional\" (E-9) work visa to 59,000, up from 52,000 this year. The Ministry of Employment and Labor and the Office for Government Policy Coordination (OPC) on Dec. 28 approved during a meeting of the Foreign Workforce Policy Committee a plan on the adoption and management of foreign workers next year, with the higher labor quota as the highlight. In expectation of continued entry and departure problems by foreign workers due to the recent surge in COVID-19\\'s omicron variant, the permissible stays of E-9 holders and those on the \"work and visit\" (H-2) visa, who are estimated at 40,000 in total number and whose visas were slated to expire between Jan. 1 and April 12, were extended for a year. The number of foreign nationals allowed to work in the country will also increase. Manufacturing companies with under 50 staff that were earlier allowed 20% more foreign staff will continue to enjoy this benefit through next year. In coastal fisheries, the number of foreign crew will be doubled from two to four per vessel. Two foreign workers will also be allowed at small-scale poultry or pork farms, and the number at a paprika cultivation venue will be raised from 20 to 25. International students on the D-2 visa for those pursuing a degree full time or studying under an exchange program can work under an E-9. Those eligible are graduates from Korean universities who unsuccessfully applied for professional employment requiring the \"professor\" (E-1) or \"specially designated activity\" (E-7) visa and wish to work under the E-9. To resolve the labor shortage in parcel delivery, food service and lodging, the H-2, a visa normally reserved for ethnic Koreans from overseas, will be available to foreign workers in the three sectors. For parcel delivery, handling land-based cargo will be added to the list of industries granting the H-2 but limited to loading and unloading cargo. In food service and accommodations, in-house cafeterias at public institutions and operation of resort condos and four to five-star hotels will be newly included. From 2023, the process of granting the H-2 to a sector will change from a \"positive\" approach in which the government names individual industries eligible to grant the visa into a \"negative\" system that simply announces business lines ineligible for it and the ones not named being eligible. Relatively high-paying sectors with no labor shortage such as finance, research and development, and information and communications will be excluded from granting the H-2. OPC Minister Koo Yun-cheol said, \"Considering the quarantine situation including the onsite labor shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years and the recent spread of the omicron variant, the government prepared a plan on adopting and managing foreign workers.\" jihlee08@korea.kr [KOCIS X KOCOWEEK X Vietnam] #K-POP Dance Challenge with Somi (ENG SUB) Making friends to share Korean culture 👩🏻\\u200d🤝\\u200d👩🏻✌ | KOREAN RHAPSODY Ep.36 Highlight ver.

              " 'D08': 'Hi, what are you looking for? By Published Malang Post – Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang (UMM) membuka kesempatan bagi masyarakat untuk bekerja di Jepang. Menggaet OS Selnajaya, Direktorat Pendidikan Vokasi dan Pelatihan Kampus Putih menyelenggarakan training centre serta pameran. Tak hanya melatih keterampilan bahasa Jepang, program ini juga memfasilitasi para peserta dalam penempatan kerja di Jepang nantinya. Direktur Pendidikan dan Pelatihan Vokasi, Dr. Tulus Winarsunu, M.Si, mengatakan bahwa program pelatihan ini diciptakan untuk membantu penyerapan tenaga kerja dari Indonesia ke Jepang. Saat ini Jepang membutuhkan 2.700.000 orang pekerja di berbagai bidang industri dan jasa. Namun pelatihan yang dikembangkan UMM saat ini masih berfokus pada bidang kaigo atau care giver saja. “Pendaftaran pelatihan ini sudah dibuka sejak akhir Desember sampai dengan Januari 2022 mendatang. Tahun lalu, kami berhasil memberangkatkan 105 orang. Semoga ke depannya akan terus bertambah. Pelatihan-pelatihan kaigo ini dapat diikuti lulusan Sekolah Menengah Atas (SMA), Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan (SMK), maupun lulusan Strata Satu (S1) yang belum memiliki pekerjaan,” ungkap dosen kelahiran Banyuwangi tersebut. Lebih lanjut, Tulus sapaan akrabnya, mengungkapkan bahwa peserta jurusan keperawatan, kesehatan, dan fisioterapi yang akan bekerja di Jepang hanya perlu lulus tes bahasa. Sementara untuk jurusan non kesehatan, selain harus lulus tes bahasa juga harus lulus pelatihan kaigo yang diberikan oleh UMM.Secara teknis, para peserta akan dikarantina selama satu tahun di Rusunawa UMM. Selama masa karantina tersebut, mereka akan dilatih dan diajari bahasa Jepang serta pelatihan menjadi kaigo. Adapun para instruktur yang membimbing didatangkan langsung dari Jepang. “Setiap dua bulan atau tiga bulan kami juga mengadakan tes untuk mengetahui perkembangan para peserta. Setelah peserta siap, kami juga menfasilitasi mereka untuk mengikuti tes wawancara dengan beberaoa perusahaan Jepang,” ungkap Tulus. Tulus menuturkan program ini sangat didukung oleh pemerintah Malang dan sekitarnya. Terbukti dengan adanya bantuan-bantuan yang diberikan pemerintah untuk roadshow dan pameran program ini. Untuk ke depannya, Tulus akan merancang beberapa pameran peluang kerja Jepang ini baik di dalam maupun luar kampus. “Saya berharap, program pelatihan ini akan bermanfaat bagi masyarakat terutama dalam pengentasan pengangguran di Indonesia,” tandasnya.

              " 'D12': 'Hi, what are you looking for? By Published Malang Post – Beberapa akademisi Fisip Universitas Brawijaya Malang, melakukan riset kemiskinan ekstrem di empat kabupaten Jawa Timur, kerjasama dengan Kemendes PDTT. Mereka adalah Dr Muhammad Lukman Hakim sebagai Kaprodi S3 Sosiologi UB, HB Habibi Subandi SSos MA sebagai akademisi jurusan Ilmu Politik, serta, Abdul Wahid SIKom MA sebagai akademisi Ilmu Komunikasi. Tim peneliti Fisip UB tersebut, merekomendasikan pelaksanaan sensus kemiskinan untuk elaborasi satu data. “Perlu ada sensus kemiskinan ekstrem di seluruh Indonesia. Ini karena adanya sejumlah temuan dari riset kami di empat kabupaten di Jatim,” kata Lukman di UB Coffee, Kamis (30/12/2021). Untuk menggelar sensus kemiskinan ini, pihaknya juga merekomendasikan kepada Kemendes PDTT untuk membuat indikator kemiskinan desa. Dan harus berlaku secara nasional. Sehingga, data sensus kemiskinan usulan dari hasil penelitian ini, bisa valid dan bermanfaat bagi upaya pengentasan kemiskinan. Dua rekomendasi sensus kemiskinan dan pembuatan indikator kemiskinan desa, berasal dari kesimpulan penelitian di empat kabupaten, yaitu Lamongan, Bojonegoro, Probolinggo dan Bangkalan. Tim peneliti ini, memakai kategori standar Bank Dunia untuk riset kemiskinan ekstrem. Yakni, pendapatan sebulan kurang dari Rp 820 ribu. Hingga muncul sejumlah hasil riset. Antara lain, ada perbedaan kultur di masing-masing kabupaten dalam definisi kemiskinan. Ada kawasan yang malu mengakui bahwa di wilayahnya ada penduduk dengan kemiskinan ekstrem. Tetapi, ada juga kawasan yang tidak segan mengaku miskin. Supaya, bisa mendapatkan kucuran bantuan. Ada kawasan yang memiliki warga dengan rumah tidak layak, tetapi memiliki sawah sepetak atau kebun jati. Kemudian, ada pula kawasan dengan rumah megah. Tetapi orang yang tinggal di dalamnya tanpa penghasilan. Dari sini, para peneliti menemukan data kemiskinan tidak valid dan tidak sinkron. Data Terpadu Kesejahteraan Sosial (DTKS) soal kemiskinan tidak sinkron dengan data Kementerian PUPR maupun Kemendes PDTT. Pertama, di Lamongan, data Pemkab menyebut ada 1191 warga miskin ekstrem. Tetapi, usai riset, ada penambahan jumlah warga miskin menjadi 1392. Di Bojonegoro, data Pemkab menunjukkan warga miskin ekstrem 7162. Namun, usai riset, data mengembang menjadi 7280 KK. Kemudian di Probolinggo, data kemiskinan ekstrem menyusut dari 3672 menjadi 2884 KK. Terakhir, di Bangkalan, data kemiskinan ekstrem menggelembung dari 10.617 menjadi 10.990 KK. Lukman berharap, dengan sensus kemiskinan berdasar indikator kemiskinan desa, pemerintah bisa memiliki satu data valid yang tepat sasaran. “Daripada triliunan rupiah mengucur tapi tidak tepat sasaran, lebih baik valid-kan dulu data kemiskinan. Supaya, pengentasan kemiskinannya tepat sasaran,” katanya. Menurut peneliti lain, Abdul Wahid, usaha keras pemerintah mengentaskan kemiskinan ekstrim dihadapkan beberapa masalah. Seperti data overlap dari pusat, daerah, dan desa sendiri. Data ini menjadi penting sebagai acuan dasar bantuan, program pemberdayaan dan sekaligus evaluasi keberhasilannya. “Bantuan langsung pada masyarakat miskin ekstrim harus diimbangi dengan program pemberdayaan secara jangka panjang”, ujar Wahid Program pengentasan kemiskinan yang semata menempatkan masyarakat miskin sebagai penerima bantuan tidak cukup. Tapi harus mulai digeser pada perspektif pemberdayaan sehingga progress pengentasan kemiskinan dapat lebih cepat. Sementara, Habibi menyebutkan, pemilihan empat kabupaten ini berdasarkan Permenkeu. Yakni peraturan berisi info tentang daerah yang presentase penduduk miskin paling tinggi di Jatim. “Kami melakukan riset ini mulai dari bulan November sampai Desember. Tujuan riset ini adalah verifikasi dan validasi data kemiskinan,” tutupnya. (yan)  Malangp Post – Hari pertama tahun baru 2022, Sabtu (1/1), tim Ops Lilin di Kota Malang tetap menjalankan penyisiran.

              " 'D14': 'Hi, what are you looking for? By Published Malang Post — Rangkaian panjang program Belajar Sehat Mental (Besment) yang digelar Badan Eksekutif Mahasiswa Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang (BEM UMM) telah ditutup Minggu (24/10/2021). Berlokasi di Gang Muharto, Kota Lama Malang, BEM UMM kali ini menggandeng Rumah Belajar Jaringan Kemanusiaan Jawa Timur (JKJT) serta Laboratorium Psikologi Terapan Keluarga dan Anak (LPTKA). Setelah mengajak anak-anak bermain dan belajar dua kali seminggu sejak awal Oktober, kini BEM UMM mengajak para ibu untuk hadir dan berbincang. Yorinda Nur Azizah, selaku ketua panitia mengaku selama sebulan mengabdi, ia dan tim merasa senang, Apalagi melihat antusiasme anak-anak yang tinggi. “Anak-anak sangat bersemangat dan mengiktui setiap rangkaian kegiatan yang telah disediakan. Kami berharap program ini dapat menggugah banyak orang agar lebih peduli dengan kesehatan mental. Dengan begitu tema ‘Penerus Bangsa Berawal dari Mental yang Sehat dan Kuat’ dapat terlaksana,” tegasnya. Berbeda dengan sebelumnya yang menyasar pada anak-anak, pada Parents Day tersebut, dilakukan diskusi para ibu dari rumah belajar JKJT. Pada kesempatan itu Siti Fatimah S.Ag., M.Si. dari LPTKA membahas terkait tumbuh kembang anak. Begitupun dengan hal-hal yang perlu diperhatikan dalam masa perkembangan tersebut. Ia juga menekankan pentingnya kesehatan mental. salah satu caranya dengan menjaga emosi, tidak hanya emosi orang tua saja tapi juga emosi anak. “Harapannya, dengan berdiskusi seperti ini, pra orang tua bisa lebih mudah memahami konsep kesehatan mental menlalui pengelolaan emosi sehari-hari, khususnya dalam mendidik anak,” tuturnya. Sementara itu, salah satu ibu, Marhamah mengatakan bahwa ia mengajarkan banyak hal kepada anaknya. Mulai dari bangun tidur, sekolah, bermain, mengaji hingga tidur lagi. Beberapa kali anaknya sulit memahami hal yang ia ajarkan. Seringkali mereka memecahkan piring dan gelas, malas mengerjakan PR dan kesalahan kecil lainnya. “Tidak jarang saya kesal dan memarahinya. Namun, berkat program ini saya memahami bahwa emosi orang tua dalam mendidik anak sangat berpengaruh terhadap tumbuh kembang anak, terutama mentalnya”, ujarnya. Terakhir, dr Veny Mayangsari, Sp.JP. selaku penanggung jawab Rumah Belajar JKJT menjelaskan. Kesehatan mental harus dilatih sejak dini. Hal itu tidak lepas dari efeknya akan pembentukan suatu karakter pada anak. Utamanya saat anak sudah mulai belajar menganalisa perilaku orang lain ataupun belajar mengenai bahasa. “Semoga melalui Besment ini, anak-anak bisa belajar menghargai orang lain. Saling berbagi dan juga bertumbuhnya karakter baik dalam diri mereka,” pungkasnya.

The move seeks to reorganize the medical response system and counter the threat of the omicron variant of COVID-19. Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum on Dec. 31 told a meeting of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters that he chaired at Government Complex-Seoul, \"We need time to prepare before the omicron variant, which is alarmingly contagious, can spread nationwide.\" \"We will extend ongoing social distancing measures for two weeks.\" Department stores, hypermarkets and large marts, which had been exempt from the vaccine pass rule, were added to the list of places requiring visitors to show such passes. The new measure will be applied for two weeks from Jan. 3-16. Vaccine passes for youth will be required from March 1, when the spring school semester stars, with a trial period of one month. Under a \"pay first, settle later\" format, the government will also compensate small business owners and the self-employed for having to forfeit the year-end peak season due to stronger quarantine measures. The prime minister said, \"This past year was extremely harsh but also a good time to confirm the people\\'s solidarity,\" thanking the public for participating in social distancing. jesimin@korea.kr 🎧 Social distancing extended 2 weeks, vaccine pass rule widened',\n",
              " 'D16': 'This article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution. Learn more about vaccines – from how they work and how they’re made to ensuring safety and equitable access – in WHO’s Vaccines Explained series. Germs are all around us, both in our environment and in our bodies. When a person is susceptible and they encounter a harmful organism, it can lead to disease and death. The body has many ways of defending itself against pathogens (disease-causing organisms). Skin, mucus, and cilia (microscopic hairs that move debris away from the lungs) all work as physical barriers to prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place. When a pathogen does infect the body, our body’s defences, called the immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome. A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body. Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes. The subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen. The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen’s antigen are an important part of the immune system. You can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your body’s defense system. Each antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen. We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies. When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen. In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill. Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease. Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like cousins. Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen. This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.  Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body. Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself. Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.  Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart. This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells. In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future. When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease. But not everyone can be vaccinated. People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines. These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated. When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune. So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens. This is called herd immunity. This is especially important for those people who not only can’t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against. No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who cannot safely be vaccinated. But with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated. Vaccinating not only protects yourself, but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated. If you are able to, get vaccinated.  Throughout history, humans have successfully developed vaccines for a number of life-threatening diseases, including meningitis, tetanus, measles and wild poliovirus. In the early 1900s, polio was a worldwide disease, paralysing hundreds of thousands of people every year. By 1950, two effective vaccines against the disease had been developed. But vaccination in some parts of the world was still not common enough to stop the spread of polio, particularly in Africa. In the 1980s, a united worldwide effort to eradicate polio from the planet began. Over many years and several decades, polio vaccination, using routine immunization visits and mass vaccination campaigns, has taken place in all continents. Millions of people, mostly children, have been vaccinated and in August 2020, the African continent was certified wild poliovirus free, joining all other parts of the world except Pakistan and Afghanistan, where polio has not yet been eradicated.

              " 'D17': \"Menu Vaccines are one of the safest and most effective ways we can reduce our risk of suffering from deadly diseases that can make us sick, send us to the hospital, or worse. All vaccines work by teaching our immune system to recognize a pathogen – a disease-causing organism. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, this pathogen is the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Then, whenever we are exposed to the virus, our immune system will be ready to leap into action, fight off the virus, and keep us healthy. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine helps protects the person who is vaccinated AND helps protect the whole community. The more people who are vaccinated, the lower the risk of catching the disease. As COVID-19 vaccination rates have increased, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 have decreased dramatically in every country that has achieved high vaccination rates. When enough people in a population are immune that the virus can no longer cause outbreaks, we say that the community is protected via herd immunity, or community immunity. Herd immunity, or community immunity, is important because it helps protect those members of a community who may be unable to be vaccinated or who may not produce a strong immune response after vaccination, due to a specific medical condition, for example. It is critical that everyone get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible. It is also urgent that everyone across the globe has access to COVID-19 vaccines to protect themselves and their communities. COVID-19 vaccines have already saved lives; ensuring that COVID-19 vaccines are available globally has the potential to save millions more. Learn more about how vaccines are rigorously tested to ensure they are safe and effective. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19 disease. When a vaccinated person comes into contact with SARS-CoV-2, their immune system (the body’s defences) responds by attacking the virus and preventing it from making them sick. There are many different ways to design safe and effective vaccines. Many COVID-19 vaccines contain instructions that teach our immune system how to make and recognize one small piece of the virus, typically the spike protein. After vaccination, our immune system responds by producing antibodies that can recognize the spike protein. In the future, if we are exposed to the virus, the antibodies we developed after vaccination will recognize this virus and stop it from spreading! COVID-19 vaccines allow us to develop the immunity that will protect us from the SARS-CoV-2 virus without getting sick. COVID-19 vaccines do not cause COVID-19 disease, regardless of the type of vaccine.  Just as there are many different makes and models of cars, there are many different types of COVID-19 vaccines. All COVID-19 vaccines are designed to prevent us from getting COVID-19. It is interesting to learn more about the technologies being used to develop COVID-19 vaccines, including how each vaccine works to strengthen the immune response so it can keep us healthy. Check out the different types of COVID-19 vaccines that have already been approved. Vaccines are some of the safest and most rigorously tested tools we have to protect ourselves from infectious diseases. As with any medical intervention, side effects can occur after getting a vaccine. The most common side effects after COVID-19 vaccination are mild and typically last 1-3 days, and include tiredness, redness or pain at the injection site, or a mild fever. Some people experience many side effects and some people don't experience any side effects at all. Common side effects can vary depending on the vaccine. Serious side effects are extremely rare. It is important to remember that the benefits of getting vaccinated and protecting yourself and others against COVID-19 are far greater than the risk of experiencing side effects. Ask your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccines if you have questions and would like to learn more about the vaccines available in your area. Retrieved from: https://www.paho.org/en/documents/typical-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine-are Make plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you are eligible and as soon as vaccines are available in your area. Be sure to receive the required number of doses so that you are fully vaccinated. As noted, COVID-19 vaccines are saving lives. Getting vaccinated as soon as you are eligible will (1) reduce your risk of getting COVID-19, (2) help protect those who cannot be vaccinated, and (3) decrease opportunities for new variants to emerge. While vaccines are the most effective way to prevent cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19, it is important to continue to follow all public health guidelines even after getting vaccinated since no method is 100% protective. Contact your local health authority to find out if you are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in your area. Visit the trials and approved vaccines by country page to learn more about which vaccines have been approved for use in each country. To reduce your risk of COVID-19, get the first COVID-19 vaccine available to you and make plans to get it as soon as you are eligible. The sooner you are vaccinated, the more likely you are to stay healthy. To reduce the number of cases, to prevent hospitalizations, to save lives, and to prevent opportunities for new variants to emerge, it is important that everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated do so as soon as possible. The best COVID-19 vaccine you can get is the one that is first available to you, so that you can reduce your risk as soon as possible. But which COVID-19 vaccine is the best? Directly comparing different COVID-19 vaccines is very difficult because they have been tested in separate clinical trials that were conducted in different settings, among people from different age groups, when different variants were circulating, and where other factors varied. If the COVID-19 vaccine you are offered is safe and effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and deaths, now is the time to get vaccinated. Contact your local health authority to find out if you are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in your area. Visit the trials and approved vaccines by country page to learn more about which vaccines have been approved for use in each country. The evidence is clear: COVID-19 vaccines are the best way to prevent COVID-19. But no method is 100% effective all of the time. Until everyone can be vaccinated, be sure to continue to follow all public health guidelines and take steps to protect yourself and others. Isolating yourself if you have any symptoms, wearing a mask, spending time outdoors rather than indoors, avoiding crowded places, and maintaining good hand hygiene can all help reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of getting COVID-19 is much higher for people who are unvaccinated than for those who are vaccinated. Globally, the vast majority of cases are occurring among unvaccinated people. However, while COVID-19 vaccines are our best bet at preventing infection, they are not 100% effective. And so, although it is extremely unlikely, it is possible to get infected even after being vaccinated. How can this be? This can happen if a person is only partially vaccinated, if there has not been enough time for the immune system to respond to the vaccine (typically 2 weeks), if a person's immune system does not respond well enough to the vaccine or, if cases are high, some people may be exposed to the virus repeatedly, thereby increasing their risk of infection. Fortunately, evidence has shown that vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease. In the rare case that a person gets infected after being fully vaccinated, they are very likely to experience much milder symptoms than if they had remained unvaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines are remarkably effective at decreasing the risk of experiencing moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, including hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. During clinical trials, each vaccine candidate is rigorously tested. Based on that evidence, health authorities will recommend how many doses are needed and the appropriate timing between doses. Some vaccines require more than one dose to train the immune system. The first dose primes the immune system, while subsequent doses induce a more robust immune response. Depending on the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, multiple doses may be required, which may be given weeks or months apart. It is important to get all recommended vaccine doses. Follow your local health authority guidelines for information on the recommended number and timing of vaccine doses. It is not yet known how long protective immunity lasts after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the degree and duration of protection may vary from person to person. Evidence has shown that COVID-19 vaccination is safe and effective even among those who already had COVID-19. Think of COVID-19 as a booster! To boost your immunity after getting COVID-19, you should still get a COVID-19 vaccine. Follow your local health authority guidelines for vaccination among those who have had COVID-19. Recommendations may include waiting a certain period of time between when you recover from COVID-19 and when you are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Retrieved from: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/advice An increasing amount of evidence suggests that most COVID-19 vaccines elicit a strong enough immune response to be effective against currently circulating variants. In particular, most COVID-19 vaccines are effective at significantly reducing the risk of severe health outcomes such as hospitalization and death. Ongoing studies continue to evaluate the evidence to determine how well COVID-19 vaccines protect against various SARS-CoV-2 variants. The more people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the more opportunities there are for new variants to emerge. Therefore, getting vaccinated as soon as you are eligible is the best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 and to reduce the risk of variants.

immediately retract its bid to have the sado mine where koreans and pows were forced to work during world war ii gain unesco world heritage status ministry of foreign affairs by kim eun-young and yoon sojung the government has demanded that japan immediately retract its bid to have the sado mine where koreans were forced to work during the japanese colonial period on the korean peninsula for unesco world heritage status ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson choi youngsam on dec 28 said in a commentary the korean government finds it deeply deplorable that while the japanese government has not fully implemented the world heritage committee s decisions and its own pledge concerning the sites of japan s meiji industrial revolution japan s agency for cultural affairs has designated the sado mine another site where koreans were forced to work as a candidate for inscription on the unesco world heritage list to get the facilities of its meiji industrial revolution including hashima battleship island on the list of unseco world heritage the japanese government in 2015 admitted to using koreans and prisoners of war pows as forced workers and pledged to build an information center to inform the world of this and honor the victims but failed to keep its word thus the committee s decision at its 44th session in july expressed strong regret over tokyo s failure to take follow-up measures as promised and urged improvement in its explanation of forced labor the korean government will sternly respond with the international community including unesco to prevent sites where people were forced to work against their will from being inscribed as a world heritage site without sufficient explanation of such historical facts the spokesperson said japan forced koreans and pows to work at the sado mine in the island nation s niigata prefecture during the pacific theater 1931-45 of world war ii screen capture from mine s official homepage during the pacific theater 1931-45 of world war ii approximately 1 200 koreans were forced to work at the mine to dig for copper and steel to produce war materials japan s agency for cultural affairs on the same day selected the mine located in niigata prefecture as a candidate for unesco world heritage it will decide whether to submit an application to that end by feb 1 2022 kyun jongho the ministry s director general for cultural affairs

              " 'D16': 'this article is part of a series of explainers on vaccine development and distribution learn more about vaccines from how they work and how they re made to ensuring safety and equitable access in who s vaccines explained series germs are all around us both in our environment and in our bodies when a person is susceptible and they encounter a harmful organism it can lead to disease and death the body has many ways of defending itself against pathogens disease-causing organisms skin mucus and cilia microscopic hairs that move debris away from the lungs all work as physical barriers to prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place when a pathogen does infect the body our body s defences called the immune system are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome a pathogen is a bacterium virus parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body each pathogen is made up of several subparts usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes the subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen the antibodies produced in response to the pathogen s antigen are an important part of the immune system you can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your body s defense system each antibody or soldier in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen we have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies when the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen in the meantime the person is susceptible to becoming ill once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease antibodies to one pathogen generally don t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other like cousins once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen it also creates antibody-producing memory cells which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies if the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen this means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future their immune system will be able to respond immediately protecting against disease vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism antigen that triggers an immune response within the body newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen some vaccines require multiple doses given weeks or months apart this is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells in this way the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future when someone is vaccinated they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease but not everyone can be vaccinated people with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems such as cancer or hiv or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines these people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated when a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune so the more that others are vaccinated the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens this is called herd immunity this is especially important for those people who not only can t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against no single vaccine provides 100 protection and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who can not safely be vaccinated but with herd immunity these people will have substantial protection thanks to those around them being vaccinated vaccinating not only protects yourself but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated if you are able to get vaccinated throughout history humans have successfully developed vaccines for a number of life-threatening diseases including meningitis tetanus measles and wild poliovirus in the early 1900s polio was a worldwide disease paralysing hundreds of thousands of people every year by 1950 two effective vaccines against the disease had been developed but vaccination in some parts of the world was still not common enough to stop the spread of polio particularly in africa in the 1980s a united worldwide effort to eradicate polio from the planet began over many years and several decades polio vaccination using routine immunization visits and mass vaccination campaigns has taken place in all continents millions of people mostly children have been vaccinated and in august 2020 the african continent was certified wild poliovirus free joining all other parts of the world except pakistan and afghanistan where polio has not yet been eradicated subscribe to newsletter related learn more questions answers resources',\n",
              " 'D17': 'menu vaccines are one of the safest and most effective ways we can reduce our risk of suffering from deadly diseases that can make us sick send us to the hospital or worse all vaccines work by teaching our immune system to recognize a pathogen a disease-causing organism in the case of covid-19 vaccines this pathogen is the sars-cov-2 virus then whenever we are exposed to the virus our immune system will be ready to leap into action fight off the virus and keep us healthy getting a covid-19 vaccine helps protects the person who is vaccinated and helps protect the whole community the more people who are vaccinated the lower the risk of catching the disease as covid-19 vaccination rates have increased cases hospitalizations and deaths due to covid-19 have decreased dramatically in every country that has achieved high vaccination rates when enough people in a population are immune that the virus can no longer cause outbreaks we say that the community is protected via herd immunity or community immunity herd immunity or community immunity is important because it helps protect those members of a community who may be unable to be vaccinated or who may not produce a strong immune response after vaccination due to a specific medical condition for example it is critical that everyone get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible it is also urgent that everyone across the globe has access to covid-19 vaccines to protect themselves and their communities covid-19 vaccines have already saved lives ensuring that covid-19 vaccines are available globally has the potential to save millions more learn more about how vaccines are rigorously tested to ensure they are safe and effective the sars-cov-2 virus causes covid-19 disease when a vaccinated person comes into contact with sars-cov-2 their immune system the body s defences responds by attacking the virus and preventing it from making them sick there are many different ways to design safe and effective vaccines many covid-19 vaccines contain instructions that teach our immune system how to make and recognize one small piece of the virus typically the spike protein after vaccination our immune system responds by producing antibodies that can recognize the spike protein in the future if we are exposed to the virus the antibodies we developed after vaccination will recognize this virus and stop it from spreading covid-19 vaccines allow us to develop the immunity that will protect us from the sars-cov-2 virus without getting sick covid-19 vaccines do not cause covid-19 disease regardless of the type of vaccine just as there are many different makes and models of cars there are many different types of covid-19 vaccines all covid-19 vaccines are designed to prevent us from getting covid-19 it is interesting to learn more about the technologies being used to develop covid-19 vaccines including how each vaccine works to strengthen the immune response so it can keep us healthy check out the different types of covid-19 vaccines that have already been approved vaccines are some of the safest and most rigorously tested tools we have to protect ourselves from infectious diseases as with any medical intervention side effects can occur after getting a vaccine the most common side effects after covid-19 vaccination are mild and typically last 1-3 days and include tiredness redness or pain at the injection site or a mild fever some people experience many side effects and some people don t experience any side effects at all common side effects can vary depending on the vaccine serious side effects are extremely rare it is important to remember that the benefits of getting vaccinated and protecting yourself and others against covid-19 are far greater than the risk of experiencing side effects ask your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of covid-19 vaccines if you have questions and would like to learn more about the vaccines available in your area retrieved from https www paho org en documents typical-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine-are make plans to receive a covid-19 vaccine as soon as you are eligible and as soon as vaccines are available in your area be sure to receive the required number of doses so that you are fully vaccinated as noted covid-19 vaccines are saving lives getting vaccinated as soon as you are eligible will 1 reduce your risk of getting covid-19 2 help protect those who can not be vaccinated and 3 decrease opportunities for new variants to emerge while vaccines are the most effective way to prevent cases hospitalizations and deaths due to covid-19 it is important to continue to follow all public health guidelines even after getting vaccinated since no method is 100 protective contact your local health authority to find out if you are eligible to receive a covid-19 vaccine in your area visit the trials and approved vaccines by country page to learn more about which vaccines have been approved for use in each country to reduce your risk of covid-19 get the first covid-19 vaccine available to you and make plans to get it as soon as you are eligible the sooner you are vaccinated the more likely you are to stay healthy to reduce the number of cases to prevent hospitalizations to save lives and to prevent opportunities for new variants to emerge it is important that everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated do so as soon as possible the best covid-19 vaccine you can get is the one that is first available to you so that you can reduce your risk as soon as possible but which covid-19 vaccine is the best directly comparing different covid-19 vaccines is very difficult because they have been tested in separate clinical trials that were conducted in different settings among people from different age groups when different variants were circulating and where other factors varied if the covid-19 vaccine you are offered is safe and effective at preventing severe disease hospitalization and deaths now is the time to get vaccinated contact your local health authority to find out if you are eligible to receive a covid-19 vaccine in your area visit the trials and approved vaccines by country page to learn more about which vaccines have been approved for use in each country the evidence is clear covid-19 vaccines are the best way to prevent covid-19 but no method is 100 effective all of the time until everyone can be vaccinated be sure to continue to follow all public health guidelines and take steps to protect yourself and others isolating yourself if you have any symptoms wearing a mask spending time outdoors rather than indoors avoiding crowded places and maintaining good hand hygiene can all help reduce the risk of sars-cov-2 transmission the risk of getting covid-19 is much higher for people who are unvaccinated than for those who are vaccinated globally the vast majority of cases are occurring among unvaccinated people however while covid-19 vaccines are our best bet at preventing infection they are not 100 effective and so although it is extremely unlikely it is possible to get infected even after being vaccinated how can this be this can happen if a person is only partially vaccinated if there has not been enough time for the immune system to respond to the vaccine typically 2 weeks if a person s immune system does not respond well enough to the vaccine or if cases are high some people may be exposed to the virus repeatedly thereby increasing their risk of infection fortunately evidence has shown that vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease in the rare case that a person gets infected after being fully vaccinated they are very likely to experience much milder symptoms than if they had remained unvaccinated covid-19 vaccines are remarkably effective at decreasing the risk of experiencing moderate to severe covid-19 disease including hospitalization and death due to covid-19 during clinical trials each vaccine candidate is rigorously tested based on that evidence health authorities will recommend how many doses are needed and the appropriate timing between doses some vaccines require more than one dose to train the immune system the first dose primes the immune system while subsequent doses induce a more robust immune response depending on the covid-19 vaccine candidate multiple doses may be required which may be given weeks or months apart it is important to get all recommended vaccine doses follow your local health authority guidelines for information on the recommended number and timing of vaccine doses it is not yet known how long protective immunity lasts after sars-cov-2 infection and the degree and duration of protection may vary from person to person evidence has shown that covid-19 vaccination is safe and effective even among those who already had covid-19 think of covid-19 as a booster to boost your immunity after getting covid-19 you should still get a covid-19 vaccine follow your local health authority guidelines for vaccination among those who have had covid-19 recommendations may include waiting a certain period of time between when you recover from covid-19 and when you are eligible for covid-19 vaccination retrieved from https www who int emergencies diseases novel-coronavirus-2019 covid-19-vaccines advice an increasing amount of evidence suggests that most covid-19 vaccines elicit a strong enough immune response to be effective against currently circulating variants in particular most covid-19 vaccines are effective at significantly reducing the risk of severe health outcomes such as hospitalization and death ongoing studies continue to evaluate the evidence to determine how well covid-19 vaccines protect against various sars-cov-2 variants the more people who become infected with sars-cov-2 the more opportunities there are for new variants to emerge therefore getting vaccinated as soon as you are eligible is the best way to protect yourself from covid-19 and to
