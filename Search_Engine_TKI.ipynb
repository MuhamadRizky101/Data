(Yonhap News) Korea.net · Gov\\'t submits upgraded emission reduction goal for 2030 By Jung Joo-ri and Yoon Hee Young The government has finalized an upgraded plan for its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030 from 2018 levels. The Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Dec. 23 said they submitted the plan to the U.N. body\\'s secretariat. The plan was finalized on Oct. 18 at the second meeting of a presidential committee on achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 with President Moon Jae-in attending. Raised from the original target of 26.3% from 2018 levels, the goal of a 40% reduction by 2030 was decided at a Cabinet meeting on Oct. 27. The submitted document presents plans and systems to implement the NDC as well as an annex with information necessary to enhance clarity, transparency and awareness under the Paris Agreement on climate change. The government plans to actively promote policy and fiscal support while setting specific phased plans to implement the NDC next year. Minister of Foreign Affairs Chung Eui-yong said, \"Though the first NDC was renewed at the end of last year, we submitted an upgraded version with a larger upward adjustment of the goal to actively contribute to the international community\\'s efforts to respond to climate change by limiting the average rise of global temperatures to 1.5 degrees or less by the end of this century.\" Minister of Environment Han Jeoung Ae said, \"To achieve carbon neutrality as a mid-term goal, the NDC seeks to focus government policy capacity and offer generous support for the transition to carbon neutrality in every sector of society.\" etoilejr@korea.kr Opening Remarks by President Moon Jae-in at 55th Cabinet Meeting (Unofficial Translation) Let me begin the 55th Cabinet Meeting. Time has slipped by and we are now only ten days away from the end of this year. It is regrettable that, following last year, we must yet again have a difficult year-end due to COVID-19. I am grateful to the people and medical professionals who have long fought COVID-19 to the best of their abilities. I’d like to ask everyone to continue to overcome hardships by encouraging one another and pulling together. The responsibility of the Government has become even heavier, and its role has also become very important. We have to soberly review and learn from what has been deemed lacking in our preparations for starting the return to normal life. Our anti-epidemic policy measures must be firmly reorganized to brace for yet another start of returning to normal. First, while putting stringent epidemic prevention measures in place, we have to do everything possible to bring the COVID-19 situation under control as early as possible. In particular, cases of severely or critically ill patients must be curbed. Our recent experience attests to the fact that COVID-19 can spread at any given time if there is the slightest breach. Mindful that the Omicron variant might become the dominant coronavirus strain, we must also make needed preparations. We have to remember that gradual and cautious steps must be taken to return to normal life – as if knocking on a stone bridge before crossing it. More than anything else, the centerpiece of the reorganization of our epidemic prevention efforts is to ensure that the medical response system is reinforced. An increase in confirmed cases can accompany the return to normal daily routines to some degree. For this reason, the medical system’s ability to protect and treat infected patients under any circumstances must be guaranteed first. In particular, no shortages should occur when treating severely or critically ill patients as the number of confirmed cases increases. The key is to secure a sufficient number of hospital beds and medical personnel. We have steadily increased the number of beds and medical professionals, but this has not been enough. Among other issues, coping with the increased number of severely or critically ill patients has been difficult. Going beyond the current plan the Government is pushing to secure additional beds, we need extraordinary, entirely new measures. I urge you to mobilize all available national university hospitals and public medical resources in order to significantly increase hospital rooms and secure additional medical personnel as early as possible. I ask related ministries and agencies to team up with the private sector and launch taskforces to take on their missions with exceptional measures and determination. The fiscal authorities should stand behind them with unsparing support. Speed matters the most. People’s lives depend on the securing of beds. I also urge you to bear in mind that the later we return to our normal lives, the greater the damage to people’s livelihoods. Cooperation from private hospitals is also urgently needed. Many private medical institutions are working together. A growing number of hospitals are offering all of their beds for the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Neighborhood clinics are also actively taking care of these patients, including those being treated at home – for which I am truly grateful. In this time of national difficulty, I ask the public and private sectors to join forces to ensure that all of their medical capabilities are mobilized to protect the people’s lives and safety. The encouraging news is that the pace of vaccinations is gradually accelerating. Most of all, the rate of administering booster shots is sharply increasing. A booster shot not only dramatically enhances immunity but also has proven extraordinarily effective in preventing severe or critical symptoms and death in particular. It is also known to be effective in defending against the Omicron variant. If the current trend holds and the pace of administering booster shots rises, this will likely contribute greatly to reducing COVID-19 risks and increasing our ability to provide needed medical care. It is also very encouraging that the idea of vaccinating children and adolescents is gaining more acceptance and that more and more of those aged 18 and older who are not vaccinated are getting inoculated. Regardless of age and social status, it is becoming a firmly rooted perception that vaccination is the most effective defense for keeping each other safe. The successful return to daily routines lies down a path never taken. We may encounter unexpected difficulties at any time. However, we will not make the same mistakes again. We will turn this brief pause into an opportune time to move forward. Trials are what make success possible. We will make it through this critical juncture and surely succeed in restoring daily routines. I urge all the ministries and agencies to come together as one and do all you can with extraordinary determination.

of the medication for more than 300 000 people far more than the 70 000 it announced earlier he added we will inform the people in depth once the ministry of food and drug safety issues emergency approval for the medicine s use and the deal is finalized since the strengthening of quarantine measures began last weekend the daily number of covid-19 confirmed cases has fallen to the 7 000 level but it s too early to conclude that a decline occurred he said we will further raise quarantine measures from this weekend and lead a definite reversal in the year s remaining week we will exert all our efforts to secure a sufficient number of hospital beds to accommodate 10 000 confirmed cases per day and boost the turnover rate in particular if the number of severely ill covid-19 patients surges switching some general beds and medical personnel to treatment of the pandemic is inevitable to overcome the crisis but please understand the difficulties of general treatment in this process he added unless absolutely necessary please visit other hospitals or clinics with capacity instead of large hospitals which are focused on covid-19 treatment on the rise of covid-19 cases among children the prime mister said the rapid spread of the coronavirus among children ages 11 or younger who are ineligible for vaccines is worrying adding the korea disease control and prevention agency

president moon jae-in at 55th cabinet meeting unofficial translation let me begin the 55th cabinet meeting time has slipped by and we are now only ten days away from the end of this year it is regrettable that following last year we must yet again have a difficult year-end due to covid-19 i am grateful to the people and medical professionals who have long fought covid-19 to the best of their abilities i d like to ask everyone to continue to overcome hardships by encouraging one another and pulling together the responsibility of the government has become even heavier and its role has also become very important we have to soberly review and learn from what has been deemed lacking in our preparations for starting the return to normal life our anti-epidemic policy measures must be firmly reorganized to brace for yet another start of returning to normal first while putting stringent epidemic prevention measures in place we have to do everything possible to bring the covid-19 situation under control as early as possible in particular cases of severely or critically ill patients must be curbed our recent experience attests to the fact that covid-19 can spread at any given time if there is the slightest breach mindful that the omicron variant might become the dominant coronavirus strain we must also make needed preparations we have to remember that gradual and cautious steps must be taken to return to normal life as if knocking on a stone bridge before crossing it more than anything else the centerpiece of the reorganization of our epidemic prevention efforts is to ensure that the medical response system is reinforced an increase in confirmed cases can accompany the return to normal daily routines to some degree for this reason the medical system s ability to protect and treat infected patients under any circumstances must be guaranteed first in particular no shortages should occur when treating severely or critically ill patients as the number of confirmed cases increases the key is to secure a sufficient number of hospital beds and medical personnel we have steadily increased the number of beds and medical professionals but this has not been enough among other issues coping with the increased number of severely or critically ill patients has been difficult going beyond the current plan the government is pushing to secure additional beds we need extraordinary entirely new measures i urge you to mobilize all available national university hospitals and public medical resources in order to significantly increase hospital rooms and secure additional medical personnel as early as possible i ask related ministries and agencies to team up with the private sector and launch taskforces to take on their missions with exceptional measures and determination the fiscal authorities should stand behind them with unsparing support speed matters the most people s lives depend on the securing of beds i also urge you to bear in mind that the later we return to our normal lives the greater the damage to people s livelihoods cooperation from private hospitals is also urgently needed many private medical institutions are working together a growing number of hospitals are offering all of their beds for the treatment of confirmed covid-19 patients neighborhood clinics are also actively taking care of these patients including those being treated at home for which i am truly grateful in this time of national difficulty i ask the public and private sectors to join forces to ensure that all of their medical capabilities are mobilized to protect the people s lives and safety the encouraging news is that the pace of vaccinations is gradually accelerating most of all the rate of administering booster shots is sharply increasing a booster shot not only dramatically enhances immunity but also has proven extraordinarily effective in preventing severe or critical symptoms and death in particular it is also known to be effective in defending against the omicron variant if the current trend holds and the pace of administering booster shots rises this will likely contribute greatly to reducing covid-19 risks and increasing our ability to provide needed medical care it is also very encouraging that the idea of vaccinating children and adolescents is gaining more acceptance and that more and more of those aged 18 and older who are not vaccinated are getting inoculated regardless of age and social status it is becoming a firmly rooted perception that vaccination is the most effective defense for keeping each other safe the successful return to daily routines lies down a path never taken we may encounter unexpected difficulties at any time however we will not make the same mistakes again we will turn this brief pause into an opportune time to move forward trials are what make success possible we will make it through this critical juncture and surely succeed in restoring daily routines i urge all the ministries and agencies to come together as one and do all you can with extraordinary determination first lady s congratulatory speech - 2021 the k-healing on festival hometown of many inventions and discoveries
